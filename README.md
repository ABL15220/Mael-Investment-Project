Mael, one of my friends and this other girl are made for each other but they each deny it and pretty much everyone in our school has tried to push them to be together. In a desperate final attempt a friend of mine, Alexis, made a bet that he
would buy one Caprisun per person 'in the marriage' (Mael, Soulmate, any children) if they ever got married. This website is made to calculate how much Mael would profit from this. Mael will sell all his Caprisuns every year at the end of
the year, and invest all the money he gets from selling the Caprisuns in the S&P 500. This program takes into account the average inflation rate over the past 10 years, and the average return of the S&P 500 over 10 years.

Obvioudly this website IS A JOKE and not meant to be taken seriously. If any of my classmates don't want there names on here they can contact me.
