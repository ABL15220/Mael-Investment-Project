Mael, one of my friends and this other girl are made for each other but they each deny it and pretty much everyone in our school has tried to push them to be together. In a desperate final attempt a friend of mine, Alexis, made a bet that he
would buy one Caprisun per person 'in the marriage' (Mael, Soulmate, any children) if they ever got married. This website is made to calculate how much Mael would profit from this. Mael will sell all his Caprisuns every year at the end of
the year, and invest all the money he gets from selling the Caprisuns in the S&P 500. This program takes into account the average inflation rate over the past 10 years, and the average return of the S&P 500 over 10 years.

There is also an option making it possible to have more realistic returns with an option for different index funds some risky with high rewards and others safer with less revenue. The program also creates a line chart of the profit that you make over time with an indicator for the divorce letting you see if Mael should have stopped investing at some point.

There is a login system which allows you to save charts to the graphs tab and download them. Every line chart saved is under the user so only they can see it. 

Obvioudly this website IS A JOKE and not meant to be taken seriously. If any of my classmates don't want there names on here they can contact me.
